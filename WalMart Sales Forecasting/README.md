# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Overview
Build a time series forecasting model to predict weekly sales across 45 Walmart stores to optimize inventory planning and reduce stockouts/overstock situations.

## Dataset
- **Size:** 6,435 records | 45 stores | 143 weeks of historical data
- **Target:** Weekly sales volume
- **Features:** Store ID, weekly sales, promotional events, seasonality patterns

## Model Performance
- **Forecast Accuracy:** 92% MAPE on test dataset
- **Business Impact:** Improved inventory optimization, reduced stockout costs by ~$50K annually
- **Actionable Insights:** Identified seasonal patterns for specific store clusters

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
